When the employee crosses particular boundary area an immediate alert message will be sent to the manager’s mobile phone. Employee monitoring system using android mobile is, essentially, software that allows Managers to monitor their Employee's office cell phone. All incoming and outgoing calls, texts and multimedia messages can be seen and interrupted by the Managers, who can also monitor where their Employee are (through GPS), access a history of where they've been and set up alerts if their Employee are going outside of approved geographical zones, are receiving texts from unapproved numbers or calls from banned persons.
